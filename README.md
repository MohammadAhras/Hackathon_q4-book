# AI-Spec Driven Technical Book

Welcome to the AI-Spec Driven Technical Book, a comprehensive resource focused on building AI applications with ROS 2 for humanoid robotics. This book is designed specifically for AI students entering the field of physical and humanoid robotics.

## About This Book

This book covers the essential concepts and practical skills needed to develop AI agents that can effectively control and interact with humanoid robots using the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). The content is structured to build your understanding progressively, from fundamental concepts to advanced applications.

Currently includes Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) and Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity).

## Modules

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Introduces ROS 2 as the middleware enabling AI agents to control humanoid robots
  - Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
  - Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy
  - Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF

- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Teaches physics-based simulation and digital twin creation for humanoid robots
  - Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
  - Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Environments with Unity
  - Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation
