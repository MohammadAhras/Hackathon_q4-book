# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the AI-Spec Driven Technical Book. This module introduces ROS 2 as the middleware enabling AI agents to control humanoid robots.

## Overview
This module covers the fundamentals of ROS 2 and its role in physical AI applications. You'll learn about nodes, topics, services, and actions, and how to create Python agents that interface with robotic systems using rclpy. Finally, you'll explore how to model humanoid robots using URDF.

## Chapters
1. [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./chapter-1-ros2-fundamentals.md) - Understanding nodes, topics, services, and actions
2. [Python Agents with rclpy](./chapter-2-python-agents.md) - Creating ROS 2 nodes in Python
3. [Humanoid Modeling with URDF](./chapter-3-urdf-modeling.md) - Representing humanoid anatomy with Unified Robot Description Format

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the ROS 2 communication model and its role in physical AI
- Create Python-based ROS 2 nodes to connect AI logic to robot controllers
- Model humanoid robots using URDF for simulation and control

## Prerequisites
