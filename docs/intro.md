# Introduction to AI-Spec Driven Technical Book

Welcome to the AI-Spec Driven Technical Book, a comprehensive resource focused on building AI applications with ROS 2 for humanoid robotics. This book is designed specifically for AI students entering the field of physical and humanoid robotics.

## About This Book

This book covers the essential concepts and practical skills needed to develop AI agents that can effectively control and interact with humanoid robots using the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). The content is structured to build your understanding progressively, from fundamental concepts to advanced applications.

## Module Structure

The book is organized into modules, each focusing on specific aspects of AI-ROS integration:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Introduces ROS 2 as the middleware enabling AI agents to control humanoid robots
- *Additional modules will be added as the book develops*

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- AI students entering physical and humanoid robotics
- Developers interested in the intersection of AI and robotics
- Anyone seeking to understand how AI agents interact with robotic systems

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (preferably with Python)
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces

## How to Use This Book

Each module is designed to be self-contained but builds on previous knowledge. We recommend:
1. Following the modules in sequence to build a solid foundation
2. Running the provided examples and experimenting with the code
3. Completing the exercises to reinforce your learning

## Technology Stack

This book focuses on:
- **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2) - as the communication middleware
- **Python** - for implementing AI agents using the rclpy library
- **Docusaurus** - for documentation and presentation
- **URDF** (Unified Robot Description Format) - for robot modeling

Let's begin our journey into the world of AI-driven robotics!
