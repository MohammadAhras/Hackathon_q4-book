# Environment Synchronization Scene

This Unity scene shows how to synchronize the Unity environment with a Gazebo simulation:

## Scene Components:
- Coordinate system alignment with Gazebo
- Data exchange protocols (ROS 2 bridge)
- State synchronization between engines
- Visual feedback for synchronization status

## Key Features:
- Transform synchronization (position, rotation)
- Time synchronization
- Physics state mirroring
- Error correction mechanisms

## Synchronization Setup:
- Network connection to ROS 2 bridge
- Message handlers for state updates
- Interpolation for smooth visualization
- Fallback systems for disconnections

## Technical Details:
- Uses Unity Robotics Package
- Coordinate system: Right-handed (Unity) to left-handed (Gazebo)
- Scale factor: 1 Unity unit = 1 meter (matching Gazebo)
- Update rate: Matches Gazebo simulation step time
