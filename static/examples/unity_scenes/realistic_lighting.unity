# Realistic Lighting Scene

This Unity scene demonstrates advanced lighting techniques for digital twin environments:

## Scene Components:
- Environment with realistic textures
- Multiple light sources (directional, point, spot)
- Reflection probes for accurate reflections
- Light cookies for complex shadow patterns

## Key Features:
- Physically-based rendering (PBR) materials
- Real-time global illumination
- Reflection and refraction effects
- Advanced shadow settings

## Lighting Setup:
- Main directional light (sun/moon)
- Ambient lighting
- Fill lights for specific areas
- Dynamic shadows

## Technical Details:
- Target platform: Desktop and WebGL
- Lighting mode: Mixed
- Real-time GI: Progressive GPU
